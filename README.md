Some useful introductions if you want to start programming:
1. ðŸŒŽ Choose your **desired** languages.
   There can be many different languages out there.
    - If you want learn to program **easily**, I suggest `Python`.
    - If you want to run code **fast** and **swiftly**, I suggest the `C` languages.
    - If you want to develop **Android** Apps, use **design** programs and `Kotlin`.
    - If you want to develop **iOS** Apps, use use **design** programs and `Swift`.
    - There are still many languages, know more by exploring the **Internet**!
2. ðŸ’» Choose a coding IDE.
   IDEs make the coding process much more easier.
    - I personally **prefer** `VS Code Studio`, it supports lots of **different** language syntax highlighting through **extensions**.
    - There are IDEs **tailored** for `Python`, for example the **default** one, `PyCharm`, and lots more.
    - For people who want to code **without** complicated IDE setups, just use `Notepad` and execute your file through `Command Prompt`.
3. ðŸ“‚ Choose your project idea.
    - What project do you want to make?
    - You can find many resources **online** to guide you through different project ideas.
